// when Statement The when statement in Kotlin is like a switch case in other languages. It checks a value against multiple conditions and executes the matching block.

fun main() {
    val marks = 7

    when (marks){
        in 1 .. 30 -> println("you failed")
        in 31 .. 50 -> println("you have average")
        in 51 .. 70 -> println("you are above average")
        in 71 .. 100 -> println("you passed")
        else -> println("invalid scores")
    }
